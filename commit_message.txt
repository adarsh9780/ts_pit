Report filename format now saved as: {ticker}_{alert_id}_{alert_date_in_human_language}.html
Example: AAPL_ALT-1023_Feb_09_2026.html

1. If same name already exists, it auto-appends _2, _3, etc. (to avoid overwrite).
2. Article count cap + priority logic. For internal report evidence (H-only articles):
    if <= 10: show all
    if > 10: show top 10
    Ranking used:
    1. number of H in materiality (desc, so effectively HHH first, then 2H, then 1H)
    absolute impact score (desc)
    2. created date (desc)

3. NEEDS_REVIEW reasoning upgraded for both flows
4. Added shared enrichment so both Analyze with AI and Agent now include:
    why it is not DISMISS
    why it is not ESCALATE_L2
    what additional info is needed to move toward dismissal
    evidence snapshot counts
