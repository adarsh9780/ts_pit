feat(agent): enforce strong-evidence dismissal guardrail and refine report evidence UX

- add shared post-analysis safety gate in `backend/alert_analysis.py`:
  - introduce `enforce_dismiss_evidence_requirements(...)`
  - only allow `DISMISS` when strong evidence thresholds are met
  - auto-downgrade weak `DISMISS` outcomes to `NEEDS_REVIEW` with detailed gap-based reasoning
  - include explicit observed vs missing evidence in `recommendation_reason`

- tighten recommendation policy prompt in `backend/prompts.py`:
  - remove low-impact-only dismissal behavior
  - require `NEEDS_REVIEW` when evidence is sparse/generic/conflicting
  - require explicit “present evidence / missing evidence / why blocked” reasoning for review decisions

- improve report evidence curation and presentation in `backend/reporting.py`:
  - include only internal articles with at least one `H` in materiality
  - replace internal evidence table with blog-style clickable article cards
  - render external news in the same card-based format
  - fix recommendation badge mapping to canonical enums (`DISMISS`, `ESCALATE_L2`, `NEEDS_REVIEW`)
