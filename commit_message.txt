Add deterministic pre-LLM causality gates for alert summaries

- run strict readiness checks before AI summary generation (required fields, valid timestamps, linked news)
- enforce pre-trade causality: only articles at/before trade boundary can justify a trade
- auto-escalate when high-impact behavior has no material pre-trade public news
- return deterministic NEEDS_REVIEW/ESCALATE_L2 outcomes when gates fail, and call LLM only when gates pass

This makes Analyze-with-AI decisions more auditable and consistent by applying deterministic policy before narrative generation.
