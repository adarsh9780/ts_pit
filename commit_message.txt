fix(agent_v3): harden prompt variable handling across planner/execution/correction

Resolves recurring runtime failures caused by prompt template variable mismatches
on VDI/Azure strict flows.

Changes:
- backend/agent_v3/prompts/execution.yaml
  - escape JSON example braces to avoid accidental `{query}` template variable
- backend/agent_v3/execution.py
  - pass `query` defensively in execution prompt invocation payload
- backend/agent_v3/correction.py
  - pass `query` defensively in correction prompt invocation payload

Why:
- Unescaped JSON in prompt text can be interpreted as template placeholders by
  ChatPromptTemplate, causing KeyError at runtime.
- Defensive prompt payloads prevent graph crashes if template vars drift.

Result:
- Planner/execution/correction prompt rendering is robust against accidental
  prompt-variable regressions.
