fix(agent-v3,respond): preserve prior execution outputs across turns and enrich final answers

- remove plan-version-only filtering when collecting completed/failed step payloads for responder context
- ensure follow-up turns (for example, "show the news") can reuse previously completed tool outputs
- strengthen respond prompt to be slightly more verbose and evidence-first by default
- require count/list answers to include exact counts plus concrete record previews from completed outputs
- prefer showing all records when small (<=10) and top 5-10 with a remainder note when larger
