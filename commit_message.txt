feat(agent-policy): hard reject submitted SQL/Python code with intent gating

- add API-level guard in POST /agent/chat to detect submitted SQL/Python snippets
- short-circuit rejected requests with SSE refusal response (token + done), avoiding agent/tool execution
- add agent_v2 intent classifier node with explicit intents
  - execute_code, data_analysis, alert_analysis, methodology_discussion, mixed, other
- route execute_code intent to dedicated rejection node in v2 graph
- extend agent_v2 state with intent_labels and disallow_execute_code
- add prompt-level policy reminders in v1/v2 to refuse user-submitted SQL/Python snippets
