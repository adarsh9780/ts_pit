chore(agent_v2): disable dynamic tool gating and bind full toolset for non-smalltalk turns

- simplify planner behavior by exposing all registered agent_v2 tools on normal requests
- keep direct smalltalk path tool-free
- reduce missed-tool failures caused by intent/gating misclassification
- update planner reason metadata to include current tool mode (`all_tools` vs `direct`)
- preserve existing graph flow while removing gating as a runtime blocker
