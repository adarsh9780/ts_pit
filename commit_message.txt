perf(impact): add staged timings, bounded fetch, parallel compute, and skip-unchanged writes

- add end-to-end stage timing logs (read/prepare/fetch/compute/write/total)
- fetch hourly data only for required per-ticker date bounds (article min/max with buffer)
- add `--workers` and parallelize per-ticker vectorized compute phase
- keep DB in WAL mode and add `busy_timeout` to reduce lock contention
- update only changed rows by comparing staged values before set-based update
