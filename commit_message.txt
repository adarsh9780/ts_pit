refactor(agent_v2): remove prescriptive tool routing and define surveillance responsibilities

- remove prompt instructions that dictate specific tool selection/order
- keep tool use autonomous based on request and bound capabilities
- rewrite runtime context hints to capability-only language (no "use first" guidance)
- add explicit agent responsibilities for alert/article analysis and materiality/impact cross-checks
