Fix deterministic summary gating and consolidate docs into two sources of truth

- Fix P0 regression in AI summary flow by including `created_date` in article payload
  passed to deterministic gates, preventing false `NEEDS_REVIEW` outcomes.
- Introduce two canonical documents:
  - `artifacts/BUSINESS_METHODOLOGY.md` (business logic, policy, governance, KPIs)
  - `artifacts/TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION.md` (architecture, contracts, pipeline, runbook)
- Simplify `README.md` to point to only the two canonical docs and clean quick-start.
- Remove stale/conflicting markdown docs to eliminate methodology drift.
- Update `scripts/test_p3_mapping.py` documentation reference to the new technical doc.

This change improves recommendation reliability, reduces documentation ambiguity,
and makes onboarding/audit conversations much clearer.
