Align deterministic impact gating, config-safe FK, and DDGS SSL behavior

- fix deterministic high-impact threshold to match canonical policy (High >= 4.0)
- use config-mapped articles ID column in article_themes FK migration
- make DDGS SSL verification respect config.yaml proxy.ssl_verify instead of forcing verify=False
- keep behavior backwards-compatible for existing DBs while improving portability and policy consistency
