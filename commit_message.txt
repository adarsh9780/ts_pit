fix(agent-ui,tool-trace): show python/sql code when tool args arrive in nested payloads

- improve tool input parsing in `AgentPanelFeature.vue` to unwrap nested argument shapes (`kwargs`, `input`, `payload`, `args`)
- keep support for double-encoded JSON tool inputs
- broaden code extraction keys so execute_sql/execute_python snippets are detected more reliably
- fix missing code blocks in expanded tool traces when tool start payload is not top-level `code`/`query`

refactor(agent-v3): cache prompt templates, standardize utils naming, and remove dead correction module

- add `lru_cache` to `load_chat_prompt(...)` so prompt YAML files are not reloaded from disk on every call
- introduce canonical `backend/agent_v3/utils.py` and migrate imports from `utilis.py` for naming consistency
- keep `utilis.py` as a compatibility shim re-exporting `build_prompt_messages`
- remove unused `backend/agent_v3/correction.py` to reduce duplicated logic risk versus `execution.py`
