fix(agent-ui): hide draft output and stream final response directly

- stop rendering respond/rewriter draft content in UI
- stream respond/answer_rewriter tokens directly into the final assistant text so users see final output without refresh
- replace draft section with lightweight "Formatting final output..." hint while final text is being prepared
- keep validator internals hidden (except debug) and remove redundant draft UI plumbing
- backend no longer emits respond/rewriter draft_update events

feat(context flow): split early summarization and late token-only metrics updates

Goal:
- Keep summarization before planning/execution (budget control), while exposing
  most up-to-date token count near final response.

Graph changes:
- backend/agent_v3/graph.py
  - add `context_metrics` node (token count only, no summarization)
  - keep `context_manager` as early node (count + optional summarize)
  - route response paths through `context_metrics` before `respond`:
    - `intent_guard -> context_metrics` for direct-respond paths
    - `master (respond) -> context_metrics`
    - `context_metrics -> respond`

Streaming debug changes:
- backend/api/routers/agent.py
  - emit `context_debug` SSE for both:
    - `context_manager`
    - `context_metrics`

Behavior:
- early node controls prompt budget and summary memory
- late node updates latest token estimate for UI/debug without mutating summary

Validation:
- `python3 -m py_compile backend/agent_v3/graph.py backend/api/routers/agent.py` passed
