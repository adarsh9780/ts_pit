- enforce `write_file` target path to `artifacts/reports/<session_id>/<filename>.md`
- add explicit error code `FS_WRITE_SESSION_SCOPE_REQUIRED` for non-session artifact paths
- increase agent_v2 filesystem max_depth to 3 to support session report subdirectories
- add prompt rule instructing session-scoped artifact write paths
