feat(schema-gen): include all physical DB columns in generated agent schema

- update `scripts/generate_schema.py` to emit every column discovered in the database
- keep config-mapped logical keys where available; use physical column name as key for unmapped columns
- add `db_column` for all entries to preserve physical identifier reference
- add `mapped_from_config` metadata per column (`true/false`)
- preserve existing descriptions when keys match from prior schema versions
- improve generator metadata/instructions to reflect mixed mapped + unmapped output
- update warnings to report included unmapped columns instead of skipping them
