feat(agent_v2): add internal methodology doc paths to system prompt for grounded scoring responses

- list canonical internal references and their purpose:
  - artifacts/SCORING_METHODOLOGY.md
  - artifacts/TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION.md
  - artifacts/BUSINESS_METHODOLOGY.md
- instruct model to ground methodology/calculation answers in internal docs/data before hypothetical formulas
- keep tool choice autonomous (no tool-order directives added)
