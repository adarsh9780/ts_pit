fix(agent_v2): prevent text→diagnose→text infinite loop in should_continue

Root cause: when the LLM responded with text (no tool_calls) after an
empty SQL result, should_continue routed to diagnose_empty_result. The
diagnostic node injected guidance, but the LLM ignored it and responded
with text again — creating an infinite text→diagnose→text loop that
produced the repeated "Next Steps" blocks.

Fix:
- Add _diagnostic_exists_since_last_tool() helper that walks backwards
  from the last message to check if a diagnostic SystemMessage was
  already injected since the last ToolMessage.
- Guard the text-only branch in should_continue: only route to
  diagnose_empty_result if NO diagnostic has been given yet. If a
  diagnostic was already injected and the LLM still responded with text,
  accept it and route to validate_answer.
- The tool_calls branch is unaffected — it still intercepts identical
  retries for further diagnostic cycles.
- Fix regex bug in _extract_sql_filters: AND/OR keywords were being
  captured as part of column names.

All 46 tests pass (4 new tests for the exact bug scenario).
