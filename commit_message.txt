fix(agent-ui): hide draft output and stream final response directly

- stop rendering respond/rewriter draft content in UI
- stream respond/answer_rewriter tokens directly into the final assistant text so users see final output without refresh
- replace draft section with lightweight "Formatting final output..." hint while final text is being prepared
- keep validator internals hidden (except debug) and remove redundant draft UI plumbing
- backend no longer emits respond/rewriter draft_update events
