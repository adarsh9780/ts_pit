refactor(agent_v2): unify web and news discovery under search_web

- update `search_web` to fetch both general web and news results in one call
- return structured payload with `combined`, `web`, and `news` sections plus counts
- deduplicate merged results by URL in `combined`
- remove `search_web_news` from agent_v2 TOOL_REGISTRY to avoid tool-choice split
- update agent tool commentary text to reflect unified web/news search behavior
