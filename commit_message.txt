feat(agent): add agent_v3 with planning-execution-correction architecture

Introduces a new agent architecture that separates planning from execution,
enabling structured step-by-step task completion with built-in error recovery.

Key changes:
- Add master-controller pattern with explicit planning phase
- Implement StepState model for granular execution tracking
- Add deterministic SQL correction with schema-aware column mapping
- Externalize prompts to YAML files for easier maintenance
- Support bounded execution with configurable retry limits

Architecture:
  START → ensure_system_prompt → master → (planner|executioner|correction|respond) → END

New modules:
- planning.py: Generates structured execution plans from user requests
- execution.py: Executes individual steps with tool argument generation
- correction.py: Handles error recovery with deterministic + LLM fallback
- state.py: Defines AgentV3State and StepState with Pydantic models
- prompts/: Externalized YAML prompt templates

Improvements over agent_v2:
- Step-granular state enables resume/retry capabilities
- Modular design (320 lines vs 1300+ in v2)
- Bounded execution prevents runaway LLM calls
- Structured correction history for debugging

Breaking changes: None (new module, v2 remains available)
