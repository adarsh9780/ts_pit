fix(agent_v2): use short provider-style tool_call ids for injected preflight calls

- change schema preflight injected tool_call id format to `call_<12 hex>`
- avoid OpenAI validation failure: max tool_call id length is 40 chars
- add test assertions for id prefix and length in schema preflight test
