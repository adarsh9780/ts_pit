feat(frontend,agent-ui): unify agent chat polish and harden alert dashboard refresh/default behavior

- streamline agent chat UI and interactions across message cards, action controls, plan rendering, and header/composer consistency
- add reusable global toast notifications and wire copy/feedback affordances with success/error user feedback
- improve streamed response rendering by tightening token/chunk joining and preserving markdown/table integrity
- prevent planner/ephemeral outputs from leaking into persisted or prompted final answers in agent v3 history/context handling
- refine frontend typography system with shared tokens, consistent hierarchy, and normalized font usage across major views
- clean up alert/detail visual semantics by consolidating color usage and simplifying action/label presentation
- fix alert detail runtime crash by guarding `created_date` before `startsWith` checks when computing table/news counts
- preserve selected alert on refresh when route includes `/ui/:alertId`
- for `/ui` (no selected alert), default to expanded sidebar, closed agent panel, and latest-date alerts so users choose an alert explicitly

fix(agent-v3,history): drop ephemeral/tool traces from persistence and bound history to 10 turns

- prevent checkpoint persistence of `ephemeral_node_output` assistant messages and tool trace messages via a persistent-only message reducer in agent v3 state
- keep planner output visible in live stream while ensuring it disappears after page refresh/history hydration
- harden `/agent/history/{session_id}` with intermediate-message filtering for ephemeral outputs and assistant tool-call traces
- enforce turn-page safety (`limit <= 10`) and return paginated user+assistant turns only
- optimize history extraction with bounded reverse scanning to reduce latency and prevent UI freeze during initial history load

fix(agent-ui): show AI message actions on hover and improve streamed message spacing

- render message action controls only for agent messages and keep them hidden by default
- reveal agent action controls on message hover/focus-within for cleaner idle chat cards
- add extra top spacing above action controls when planner/tool/formatting sections are present
- reduce cramped layout while responses are still streaming with plan/tool traces visible
