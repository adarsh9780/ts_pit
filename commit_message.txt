Align P3 theme tiers across docs and code

- document an explicit P3 category-to-tier contract in SCORING_METHODOLOGY.md
- add a lightweight regression script (scripts/test_p3_mapping.py) to prevent drift in calculate_p3 behavior
- validate expected High/Medium/Low mappings, including case-insensitive and substring handling

This keeps policy and implementation in sync and reduces future scoring inconsistencies.
