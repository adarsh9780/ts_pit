refactor(db): add SQLAlchemy schema validation and move alert analysis to dedicated table

- add SQLAlchemy Core db layer (engine, schema contract, startup validator)
- remove runtime schema mutation from app startup and price cache paths
- fail fast on startup with explicit missing table/column errors
- add alert_analysis store service and keep API response shape stable
- switch summary write path to insert into alert_analysis (no writes to alerts analysis columns)
- switch alert read paths to merge latest alert_analysis record
- add migration/backfill utility for alert_analysis table
- add cleanup utility to remove legacy analysis columns from alerts after transition
- add agent mode config toggle support and dynamic workflow loading (v1/v2)
