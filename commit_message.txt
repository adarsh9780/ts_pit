refactor(scripts): group utilities by task type with unified dispatch

- Added grouped script entrypoints: `db_ops.py`, `scoring_ops.py`, `schema_ops.py`, `dev_checks.py`, `data_ops.py`.
- Added shared script dispatcher (`_script_runner.py`) and unified router (`scripts/cli.py`).
- Preserved backward compatibility by keeping existing utility scripts as execution targets.
- Updated backend README with grouped script and unified CLI usage examples.
