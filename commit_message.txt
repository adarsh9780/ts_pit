fix(agent_v2): include tool messages in model context after tool calls

- preserve `tool` messages in agent_v2 `_messages_for_model` payload construction
- prevent OpenAI chat contract violation where assistant `tool_calls` lacked matching tool responses
- keep summary/trimming behavior unchanged by only including tool messages for model invocation path
