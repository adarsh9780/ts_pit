feat(agent-ui): surface draft updates as muted ribbons and keep validator hidden by default

- SSE: emit `draft_update` events for ephemeral outputs from `respond` and `answer_rewriter`
- SSE: keep `answer_validator` hidden unless debug stream is enabled (`?debug=1` or `x-agent-debug: true`)
- keep planner output visible via fallback path
- frontend: handle `draft_update` in `useAgentChat` and store as `segment.type='draft'`
- frontend: render draft segments as muted ribbons in `AgentPanelFeature.vue`

feat(agent-ui): move context debug to composer ring, collapse ephemeral traces, and restore v3 streaming

- move top context debug strip into a bottom circular progress ring beside send/stop
- show hover tooltip with context memory, token estimate, and summarization trigger state
- group ephemeral segments (planner, draft updates, tools) under collapsible "Working details"
- auto-collapse ephemeral details once a final assistant answer is present
- stream planner/respond/answer_rewriter model chunks from backend with node metadata
- include node name in token events and use per-node fallback suppression to avoid missing final outputs
- keep answer_validator hidden by default (only emitted as draft update in debug mode)
