fix(agent_v2): stop retry loop from repeating "Next Steps" on empty tool results

- Remove empty_call retry branch from should_continue's no-tool_calls path;
  text-only LLM responses should not be re-routed to retry_after_tool_error.
- Skip validate_answer rewrite when the last tool call returned empty data,
  avoiding an extra agent loop that compounds with the retry loop.

Fixes: agent producing 5 repeated "Next Steps" blocks instead of respecting
max_tool_error_retries (3) from config.yaml.
