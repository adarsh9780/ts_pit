refactor(backend): modularize alert analysis, routing, and service layers

- split main API surface into dedicated routers (alerts, market, agent, reports, settings)
- normalize alert response shape at backend source for consistent frontend consumption
- refactor alert_analysis into orchestration + dedicated policy/data service modules
- extract market/price cache provider helpers and keep prices.py as a stable facade
- wire config-driven loguru logger and remove fallback logging path
- remove legacy mappings endpoint and clean stale frontend router imports
