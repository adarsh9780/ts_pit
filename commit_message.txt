Refactor agent to use non-persisting alert analysis and JSON tool contracts

- add shared non-persisting analysis module (deterministic gates + LLM summary + citations)
- route /alerts/{id}/summary through shared analysis core, then persist only in API endpoint
- add agent tools: analyze_current_alert and get_current_alert_news (strict in-window evidence)
- remove write-capable and generic ticker-news tools from agent binding
- enforce analysis-first behavior for current alert intents and require evidence citations
- standardize bound tool outputs to structured JSON {ok,data,error,meta}
