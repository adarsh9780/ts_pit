- add non-persisting report generation flow accessible via agent tool
  - introduce `generate_current_alert_report` and bind it in the agent graph
  - enforce JSON-structured tool outputs and keep report generation read-only from agent side

- align report content with investigation workflow
  - include deterministic + LLM analysis with citations
  - include both materiality-high section and all internal alert-window articles
  - add optional external web-news enrichment
  - save reports under session-scoped artifacts path and expose download metadata

- capture the exact chart shown in UI for reports
  - add frontend chart snapshot capture hook from alert view
  - add backend chart snapshot upload endpoint
  - make report renderer prefer uploaded UI snapshot, fallback to backend-generated chart SVG

- move from inline chat links to artifact-centric downloads
  - add backend session artifact listing endpoint
  - add secure artifact download endpoint by relative path
  - emit `artifact_created` event from agent stream on report generation
  - update chat UI to show artifact menu and refresh artifacts on new outputs

- redesign agent composer for better UX
  - replace single-line input with multiline textarea composer
  - support Enter-to-send and Shift+Enter for newline
  - add compact icon-only artifact trigger and circular send/stop control
  - normalize textarea typography and reduce icon/button visual weight
  - set default composer height to two lines

- strengthen agent behavior guidelines
  - always include “Next steps” after recommendation responses
  - ask explicit HTML confirmation before generating downloadable report
  - require confirmation before calling report tool unless HTML is already explicit
