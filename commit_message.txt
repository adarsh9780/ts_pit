refactor(safe_py_runner): simplify policy to memory + timeout + blocked imports/builtins

- remove complex mode matrix (allowlist/denylist/restricted write-guard toggles)
- keep wall-clock timeout and memory limit as first-class controls
- switch to denylist model: allow by default, block configured imports and builtins
- add `max_input_json_kb` input-size guard
- update `get_python_capabilities` and runtime context to expose simple policy fields
- refresh config defaults with sensible blocked imports/builtins
