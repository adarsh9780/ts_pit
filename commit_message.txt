feat(agent-ui): improve agent v3 working-details UX and streaming behavior

- move context debug status from top strip to bottom composer ring with hover details
- restore v3 node streaming for planner/respond/answer_rewriter and include node metadata in token SSE events
- use per-node fallback suppression so final outputs are not dropped when planner streams first
- split working details into clearer sections:
  - Plan: dedicated collapsible section rendered as readable markdown (parsed from planner JSON when possible)
  - Tools: shown in normal flow with existing traces and statuses
  - Draft updates: separate collapsible section for respond/rewriter ephemeral text
- auto-collapse Plan and Draft updates once final answer is ready
- keep answer_validator hidden unless debug stream is enabled
