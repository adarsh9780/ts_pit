feat(search): add company name search to sidebar

This commit introduces the ability to search for alerts by company name, in addition to the existing ticker search. The changes span both the backend and frontend to ensure a seamless "2 in 1" search experience.

Key changes:
-   **Backend**:
    -   Added `company_name` column to the `alerts` table in `backend/config.yaml`.
    -   Updated `backend/scripts/generate_dummy_data.py` to populate company names based on a ticker mapping (e.g., AAPL -> Apple Inc.).
    -   Regenerated the dummy database to include the new column and data.
-   **Frontend**:
    -   Enhanced `frontend/src/features/alerts/views/DashboardLayoutView.vue` to filter alerts by checking both `ticker` and `company_name` fields.
    -   Updated the search input placeholder in `frontend/src/components/AlertsSidebar.vue` to "Search Ticker or Company...".

This improvement allows users to find relevant alerts even if they only recall the company name and not the specific ticker symbol.
