fix(agent-stream): avoid duplicate final text across respond/rewriter transitions

- treat respond and answer_rewriter as a single final-answer stream
- if final node switches (respond -> answer_rewriter), replace prior final text instead of appending
- broaden fallback dedupe to skip replay when text is already contained
