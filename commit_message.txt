feat(ui): support per-alert deep links and persist dashboard/detail state

- add route support for `/ui/:alertId` and keep dashboard rendering on direct alert URLs
- sync selected alert with route params so refresh reopens the same alert
- persist dashboard UI state (filters, sidebar collapse, agent panel) in localStorage
- persist per-alert detail preferences (theme, period, chart/view modes, summary tab)
- align legacy alerts table navigation to use `alertId` route param
