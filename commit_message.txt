agent_v3: add planner tool-hint nudges, enforce actionable fallback steps, stop streaming raw planner JSON, and fix web-news/report query behavior with ordered DDGS backends
agent_v3/frontend: prevent plan expand auto-scroll jump by removing deep message auto-scroll watcher; continue executing pending required steps even when a prior step failed; add master routing regression tests
agent_v3/execution: treat empty search_web results as non-fatal, retry once with broadened params, then deterministically mark search_web as skipped and continue remaining steps; add regression tests for empty/error retry-skip flow
