refactor(db+frontend): complete SQLAlchemy migration and fix alert detail render crashes

- migrate remaining backend data paths to SQLAlchemy Core (settings, price cache, alert analysis store, agent SQL tool)
- remove cursor/raw-SQL compatibility flow in alert_analysis_data and make tests SQLAlchemy-only
- refactor alert analysis data tests to run against temp SQLite via SQLAlchemy engine
- harden alert detail bundle loading with partial-failure tolerance (allSettled for prices/news)
- fix AlertNews null/typing render crashes (safe sentiment/theme handling and impact score formatting)
- keep alert detail UI visible even when dependent requests partially fail
