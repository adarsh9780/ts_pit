fix(agent-ui): align stop/send controls and clean up stop icon

- group send/stop button with context ring in a right-side toolbar cluster
- prevent stop button from drifting to center due to space-between layout
- replace text glyph stop icon with a centered square block for stable rendering

chore(agent-ui): swap context ring and send/stop button positions in composer

- place context token ring before send/stop control on the right toolbar cluster
- keep existing behavior and styling unchanged otherwise
