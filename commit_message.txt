fix(agent-v2): enforce retry guidance visibility and align retry cap with config

- include per-turn retry/rewrite control `SystemMessage`s in model input so retry instructions are actually applied
- increase `agent_v2.retries.max_tool_error_retries` from 1 to 3 in `config.yaml`
- add regression coverage to ensure retry/rewrite control messages are present in `_messages_for_model`
