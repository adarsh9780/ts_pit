feat(agent-ui): code-focused SQL/Python tool cards + context-aware tool action summaries

- update tool commentary generation in agent stream router to be input-aware
  - execute_sql: references query intent and table usage
  - read_file: references selected path
  - execute_python: references bounded computation/type validation intent
- for SQL/Python tool traces, show only read-only code block with Copy button
- hide generic input/output blocks for non-code tools; keep Action + Error sections
- style SQL/Python code display as editor-like read-only panel
