fix(agent-v3,planner): plan answer-complete evidence instead of minimal outputs

- update planner policy to target answer-complete results so responder can present concrete evidence directly
- require count/list intents to plan for exact totals plus representative records (or all records when small)
- prefer reuse when relevant records already exist in completed steps, otherwise append retrieval steps
- strengthen step guidance to support user-facing presentation (rows/headlines/dates), not just aggregate metrics

fix(alert-news-ui): make article titles link-aware on hover and improve summary text wrapping

- render news titles as clickable links when URL fields are present (`url`, `article_url`, `link`, `news_url`)
- keep default title styling unchanged so links look like normal titles until hover/focus
- add subtle underline affordance on hover/focus to indicate original-article navigation
- remove measure cap for news summaries and force full-width wrapping to use all available card space
- improve long-text wrapping with `overflow-wrap:anywhere` for dense summaries

fix(agent-v3,respond): prevent stale failure leakage and accept numeric alert ids for report tools

- keep responder access to all completed outputs, but restrict failed-step context to current plan version only
- prevent old, unrelated failures from being surfaced as current-turn technical issues
- update `analyze_current_alert` and `generate_current_alert_report` tool signatures to accept `alert_id` as `string | integer`
- remove recurrent validation mismatch when frontend/current alert context provides numeric alert ids
