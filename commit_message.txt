feat(agent_v2): zero-duplicate validation flow via route_after_tools

Refactored graph wiring to intercept empty/failed tool outputs *before* the agent sees them.

Previously, the agent would see an empty result, generate a "No data" text output, THEN `should_continue` would route to diagnosis, causing a second "No data" response after the retry (and potentially looping).

New `route_after_tools` conditional edge detects the need for diagnosis immediately after tool execution. If diagnosis is needed (and retries remain), it routes to `diagnose_empty_result`, injects the guidance, and THEN the agent runs. This ensures the agent has the diagnostic context for its *first* response attempt in that cycle, eliminating the "No data" text duplication entirely.

Also cleaned up graph wiring to remove duplicate edge definitions.
Updated tests to verify `route_after_tools` logic.
All 50 tests passing.
