fix(agent-v2): harden tool-call sequencing and empty SQL retry behavior

- prevent dangling assistant `tool_calls` blocks from being sent without matching tool responses
- sanitize model context to include only complete ai/tool message pairs and avoid `tool_call_id` protocol errors
- improve empty-result detection to retry when aggregate SQL returns only zero-like values (e.g., `COUNT(*) = 0`)
- keep existing retry-cap controls while enabling schema/type correction retries for false-empty SQL outcomes
- add regression tests for dangling tool-calls and aggregate-zero retry routing
