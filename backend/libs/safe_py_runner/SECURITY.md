## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within `safe-py-runner`, please report it via GitHub Issues (or email if desired).

## Threat Model & Limitations

**`safe-py-runner` is a guardrail layer, NOT a robust OS-level sandbox.**

It is designed to run semi-trusted code (e.g., generated by your own LLM agents) with safety nets against accidents (infinite loops, excessive memory usage) and basic restrictions (blocking `os.system`).

**Do NOT use this library to execute arbitrary code from anonymous public users** without additional layers of isolation such as:
- Docker containers
- Virtual Machines (Firecracker, gVisor)
- `nsjail` or comparable OS-level sandboxing tools.

This library relies on Python runtime hooks and subprocess isolation. A determined attacker with sufficient knowledge of Python internals may be able to bypass these restrictions.
